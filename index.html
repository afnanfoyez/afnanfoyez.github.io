  <h1 style="color:blue;">Computer Science</h1>
  <p1 style="color:red;">Hello, My name is Afnan Foyez I am from Queens NY, currently studying computer science here at the University at Buffalo.
	My first semester here has been nothing short of amazing. The people here are extremely kind and always full of love and support. Coming from a city like Queens
	to one like Buffalo was a hard transition at first but as soon as classes began and I met like midned people it was all better. 
	CSE 119 has been a surprising class for me, the flipped classroom method allowed us to 
	be able to do hands on activities instead of listening to lectures. It was a different experience, one that helped me in other classes such as CS 115. 
	The concents in the class were explained well and everything was understandable. 
	Being able to truly grasps concepts while working by myself gave me confidence and satisfaction that I didn't always feel in my other classes. The TA's were always there to help and I felt that they truly cared.</p1>

	<p2 style="color:red;"> My semester here has ended and although I love it here I am looking forward to going back home. I am looking forward to seeing my friends and family, but most of all I al looking forward to being in my city.
		A city that is incredibly beautiful, a city with people from all over the world who are all chasing the American dream, a city with beautiful architecture that I can never get tired of.</p2>
